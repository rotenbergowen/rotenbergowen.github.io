### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Part 1 of our 5th lab of the semester was very impactful in my journey to
    become a programmer. I was tasked with making a Mad Lib that would prompt
    the user for words and then put them all together and output a sentence.
    This was the first time I made an interactive program where my inputs
    would have a direct effect on what was outputted by the program.
    This was a big step forward and it layed the groundwork for the rest
    of my labs.

* Lab 8

    In the first part of lab 8, my task was to search a text file,
    identify palendromes, and to print them out for the user to see. I really
    find this skill valuable because it bridged the gap between making a
    program that only takes input from the command line or prompting the user
    and reading data from an outside file. For any job in the future where
    I may need to interpret a large amount of data, there is no better way
    to do it than with a computer program. I will improve on this basic skill
    and I will no-doubt use it in the future.

* Lab 10

    The third and final part of this difficult lab required the use of the
    Graphics Magick plugin to create a square png image with different
    colors fading togethere creating a rainbow gradient. Nested loops were used
    to individually go through each row and column of pixels, decide a color
    using math to make it fade evenly, and add it to the image. I really
    enjoyed this lab because of the final image I created. It was a beautiful
    picture that I made, rather than some boring text like in the previous
    lab. I finally was able to take my coding skills and create a piece of art
    and my new understanding of doing this will definitely help in the future.
